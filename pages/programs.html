    <h2>Programs We Offer</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">The Main Sectors of Future Education</p>
    <p>At StackJAM Institute we believe that the future of education is certainly STEM. Hence, we curated a program and system that focuses heavily on Mathematics, Computer Science, the Sciences, and of course in order to garner a deep understanding of any form of education, English (main language of instruction). As a result these are our four courses of focus that will immerse young minds in a fresh and revolutionary learning system that will adequately prepare them years ahead of their peers.</p>

      <h3>Mathematics</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Subjective, practical and logical, math serves as the basis of STEM</p>
      <p>Mathematics is an expansive academic field that includes the study of concepts such as algebra, geometry, and number theory. The subject of math is an essential field of logical and abstract reasoning which developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. This field utilizes the study of patterns to determine the truth or falsity of a novel postulate through the use of rigorous mathematical proof. Therefore, Mathematics is an integral aspect of many academically rigorous fields including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences.</p>
      <p>At StackJAM, our tutors are qualified to teach mathematics from Grade 1-10 and prepare students for Mathematics contests such as the American Math Competition, COMC, Waterloo contests and more.</p>

      <h3>Computer Science</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">print("Welcome to StackJAM Institute!")</p>
      <p>Computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.</p>
      <p>At StackJAM our tutors are qualified to teacher a wide variety of coding languages such as C++, Java, Javascript, Python, R, Go, Visual Basic, and more.</p>

      <h3>Science</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Experimenting and testing in the quest for finding out why things are they way they are?</p>
      <p>Science, any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation. In general, a science involves a pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws. Science can be divided into different branches based on the subject of study. The physical sciences study the inorganic world and comprise the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences. The biological sciences such as biology and medicine study the organic world of life and its processes. Social sciences like anthropology and economics study the social and cultural aspects of human behaviour.</p>
      <p>At StackJAM, our tutors offer their personal experiments and projects to supplement their teaching. This ensures that students will get an immersive real-world education from award winning tutors in OAPT Physics, and AP and IB curricula. It can be assured that our tutors are more than qualified to teach grades 1-10.</p>

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">From nursery stories to the study of Homer's Iliad</p>
      <p>English, as an academic concept, includes the teaching of the fundamentals of the language such as listening comprehension, fluency development, oral intelligibility, reading, grammar, writing, and vocabulary development. This academic field also requires a thorough analysis of English literature from a variety of periods and geographical regions; establishing meaningful evaluations and interpretations of the text. This discipline is essential in supplementing communication and social skills necessary for survival in modern society.</p>
      <p>At StackJAM, our tutors offer their own experiences with the Ontario English Curriculum and the necessary skills to succeed within this academic subject.</p>

      <h3>French/ Fran√ßais</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Learn to speak and write French proficiently</p>
      <p>French, as a subject in the Ontario Curriculum, requires that students be able to listen and respond to speak, interact, read, view, and write in the French language. Students learn the fundamentals of the language and develop an adequate knowledge of the mechanics of the French language. We hope that they are able to gain a better understanding of not just the language itself but also French culture.</p>
      <p>At StackJAM institute, our National Award winning tutors offer supplementary French education from grade 1-8 and will help reinforce knowledge of the language learned from school.</p>
