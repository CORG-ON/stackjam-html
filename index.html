      <h3>General Background</h3>
      <p>
        StackJam is a place where <u>overachieving and ambitious</u> <b>IB</b> and <b>AP</b> high school scholars gather
        to educate others as well as gain invaluable experiences. We believe that this organization is meant to help
        students in need of assistance with academics; or simply those who just want to get ahead.

      <p class="fade-in-3-pre">
        We offer a variety of classes, abundance of choices, and guest speakers that embody academic excellence (from
        Waterloo, U of T, MacMaster, Queens and more) in and outside of a practical learning environment. Our
        organization believes that <b>trust, ambition, goals, persistence, trials, and integrity</b> are one of the most
        important traits a student can possess. We hope to spread our beliefs among many other students and help them
        successfully achieve their goals in life.
